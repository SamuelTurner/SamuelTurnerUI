# Samuel-Turner UI

This is my starting point for the UI for my personal projects. It's built on inuit.css V5.0.

Feel free to use it if it will help you out, but I won't be offering any support or anything yet. This is mainly to stop me from duplicating my styles all the time!

## Demo

You can view a working demo of this project here: (http://samuel-turner.co.uk/demos/samuelturnerui/latest/)

## Usage

Just copy the samuelturnerui directories into your CSS and JS directories, and modify your style.scss file to import "samuelturnerui/samuelturnerui".
