# SamuelTurnerUI-core

This is the core of SamuelTurnerUI, containing nothing other than the code I have written.

This is intended to be included as a sub-module along with a few other things, so you must include [inuit.css](https://raw.github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css/) in order to compile and use the CSS using SASS. The JS requires jQuery and I suggest including and minifying it with [SimpleJSMinifier](https://github.com/SamuelTurner/SimpleJSMinifier).

## Usage

Add SamuelTurnerUI-core as a submodule within your git project:

    $ git submodule add git@github.com:SamuelTurner/SamuelTurnerUI-core your-local-folder
