# Samuel-Turner UI

This is my starting point for the UI for my personal projects. It's built on inuit.css V5.0.1.

Feel free to use it if it will help you out, but I won't be offering any support or anything yet. This is mainly to stop me from duplicating my styles all the time!

## Usage?

Just copy the samuelturnerui directory into your CSS directory, and modify your style.scss file to import "samuelturnerui/samuelturnerui".
